## Description


This was an attempt by me to come back into an old assignment and make sure that I redo it correctly this time instad of the lazy garbage that I put together the first time. This time seems to be a much better result, but then again that will be for the grader to determine.

### What problems does this project solve?

My inability to graduate as the last version of this application that I turned in fell below the 60% threshold and put it as a nonstarter.

### What did we learn along the way?

That I need to make sure that even when I am tired beyond belief that I still need to get up and do my best. Perhaps if I did that consistantly through this entire course I would be facing way less problems than I am now.

### What makes this project stand out?

One of the few assignments that I had to come back and refinish. I hope that I as I approach the last leg of this course I can be much more of an asset than what I have been as of late.
